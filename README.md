#### If you don't like reading, then just follow this :arrow_down: and enjoy. :sunglasses:

1. Make a new repo (say testRepo)
2. Run the file run.sh, it will ask you the information like username and id, enter it.
3. You will obtain a file writer.sh, just copy that file in your cloned version of "Repo" and run it, that's all...

#### I want my name in darker color, what to do.?

- Just increase the number of commits when asked for while running the script run.sh

#### How to select date from which I want to start writing my name

- That's simple, go to you profile page and select a base block from which you want to start writing your name, just inspect element it, you will see a value for data-date, this is it.

The first quantity is year, second is month and third is date, just add these info when you run the script run.sh

For help, here are two screenshots

1. **Base date** (Your name will appear 5 blocks, from this block date's level.)
   - Get the graph date by selecting the block on the contribution graph, you wish to start. in format (ex. 2023-02-20)

#### What if I want to change the pattern of some alphabets.

- Now that's simple, go to the components folder, you will find a file named alphabets, just draw your pattern in that file, run bash parse.sh and that's it, your final output is in finalIndexing.txt, just replace all this obtained value of variables and arrays in the file main.py (replacing the old one). Now what are you waiting for, go and run your newly customized main.py. :smile:

#### What about numbers.?

- ~~I'll add them soon, but you know what, you can also fork the repository, go give it a shot.~~

Edit :- Numbers are added.
